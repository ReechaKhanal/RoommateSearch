All of our group members have contributed to both front-end and back-end. We don't have a strict team division and have been working on tasks in need basis.

## Project Description

Our project aims at helping students or people who have moved to a new town ease their move process by helping them find roommates and getting used to the new town. Our main feature for this project will be finding roommates based on one's location and other criterias. We want to enable potential-roomates with similar interests to be matched to and contact one another. 

## Technology Stack:
Front-end: Angular version 11.0.0
Back-end: Golang 1.17.6

## Development server

Run `go run .` in the `/server` directory for the back-end server. The server will run on `http://localhost:8080` and will be accepting requests.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `server/static` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `go run -tags prod` to run the static build of the website.

## Running backend tests

Run `go test -run app_test.go` in the `/server` directory

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
